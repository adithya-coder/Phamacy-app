Digital Pharmacy App

Introduction to the project


Generally, the introduction to the world has changed the shopping habits of people. Most people want to get things online whenever and wherever. However, the medical sector is a way behind the as we have a very limited number of online stores. Our idea is to design an online pharmacy store patients will be able to get drugs prescribed by a doctor or specialist and get consultations from the pharmacists instead of having to move around locally in search of a drug or health product. With the internet being an important part of our lives, it was not a surprise that pharmacies stared to move to online platform. So, what is an online pharmacy? The online pharmacy is a business that deals with the preparation and sale of prescription and non-prescription drugs as in traditional pharmacies. However, online pharmacies take orders online and send the drugs to their destination by post.

“Digital Pharmacy” app allows to register the legally approved pharmacies to sell their drugs by adding their drugs and other approved products, Cosmetics, and First aid kid items and allows the local customers to buy their needed drugs and the other things that sell by the approved pharmacies within 24 hours via online. In our app, we will add a special concept in our pharmacy system. If a customer needs to buy a drug other than First aid kid and Cosmetics. Customers can add the drugs and other things in the cart. They can submit their doctor’s prescription to the pharmacy that they select to buy. Pharmacy pharmacist check the prescription is that prescription is original or not. If it is an original prescription. Customers can pay the required amount to the pharmacy by Debit Card or Credit card, Bank and Cash on delivery. Finally, the customers can receive their Ordered items after the successful payment.
